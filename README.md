This is a complete re-make of the original V-Hud that was published a little bit ago, if you have any suggestions, please go ahead and let me know as i will be attempting to support this for as long as possible.

#### **Script Information**
1. Performance: Runs at 0.00 Resmon (Client).
2. Completely standalone meaning no other dependencies required.
3. Settings page with advanced customization, along with multiple HUD Mode's so each user can have a unique experience.
4. Optional support for framework specific features, such as displaying hunger and thirst for the selected frameworks: ESX, QB, vRP.
